- Geolocation Services

Description: Using GPS and mapping services to provide location-based features.

i. Key Features:

a. Real-time location tracking.

b. Geofencing (e.g., triggering actions when a user enters a specific area).

c. Integration with maps (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox).

d. Use Cases: Ride-sharing apps, food delivery, fitness tracking.

- Multimedia Support

Description: Enabling the app to handle images, videos, audio, and other media formats.

i. Key Features:

a. Image and video upload/download.

b. Audio playback and streaming.

c. Camera and microphone access.

Benefits: Enhances user engagement and functionality.

- Personalization
